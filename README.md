# hello-world
Brand New to GitHub and learning to Code
I am a self-employed handyman by trade. I am learning to code because I dont want to do this forever, I want to continue traveling the world.
My girlfriend is beginning an entrepeneurial journey into microblading and ombre brows which is basicall permanent make-up.
Her and I wanted to make a website which hosts a community for beauty professionals to promote themselves, reach out to customers, set appointments, 
and make money. So I am beginning my Journey with this. And my entrance into Github will forever be recorded with this introduction of myself and my intentions.
